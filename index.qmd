My name is Gabriel Hobro.

I am a senior analytical manager at NHS England. This is my attempt at a Quarto website on GitHub as per Pablo Leon Rodenas's guidance.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(NHSRtheme)
data(mtcars)
```

Let's "glimpse" at the data.

```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

We will attempt to present miles per gallon (mpg) against weight (wt) for the cars in the data set.

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x) +
  ggtitle("mpg vs wt | mtcars data set") +
  NHSRtheme::theme_nhs()
```
